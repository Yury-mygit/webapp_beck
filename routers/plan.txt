# How reliable is this protection, can you give recommendations for improvement?

# Use HTTPS: Always use HTTPS in production. This prevents attackers from intercepting the traffic between the client and the server.
# Secure Cookies: Set the secure attribute for your cookies. This makes sure that the cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
# SameSite Cookies: Set the samesite attribute for your cookies. This can help to prevent CSRF attacks.
# Password Hashing: Never store passwords in plain text. Always hash and salt passwords before storing them. You can use libraries like bcrypt or passlib for this.
# Token Expiration: Tokens should have an expiration time, after which they are no longer valid.
# Token Revocation: Implement a way to revoke tokens when necessary. For example, you might want to revoke a token when a user logs out, changes their password, or if you suspect the token has been stolen.
# Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
# User Verification: Implement some form of user verification (like email verification) to ensure that accounts are being created by legitimate users.
# OAuth2 or JWT: Consider using a more secure authentication scheme, such as OAuth2 or JWT.
# Security Headers: Use security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and X-Content-Type-Options to protect your site from various types of attacks.
